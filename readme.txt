NextGEN Z Cropper is a plugin that resizes and crops(!) your pictures while uploading them (not only thumbnails!). If the picture does not match your prefered size it will be resized and cropped to display the maximum possible amount out of the center of the original picture. This plugin requires Alex Rabe's - NextGEN Gallery Plugin, otherwise no functionality ;)
